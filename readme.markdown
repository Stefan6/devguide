# OGS Developer Guide #

This is the source code of the OGS developer guide. It gives instructions on how to contribute to the *OpenGeoSys-6 development*. If you only want to use OGS please have a look at the upcoming *OGS Data Explorer Manual* found on the [OGS wiki][ogs_wiki]. Several step-by-step guides will help you to get started quickly on all supported platforms. Further on there are sections about how the OGS project is structured, which configurations exist and how to establish a new release. For testing and releasing a new version the automated build and benchmarking system is presented and an introduction to its usage is given. A section on development best practices concludes this guide.
