<p class="intro">This guide will show you how to build the project on <strong>Windows</strong>. There are also guides for <strong><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/linux-build">Linux</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/mac-build">OSX</a></strong>.</p>

## Build with Visual Studio ##

Open the *OGS.sln* either by double-clicking it in the file browser or opening in Visual Studio via *File / Open / Project*.

On the project explorer right-click on *ogs* or *ogs-gui* and choose *Set as startup project*. Then press *F5* or click the green arrow to build and start the project.

## How to work with CMake and Visual Studio ##

You can work normally in Visual Studio but remember that you have to make project changes in the *CMakeLists.txt* and not inside Visual Studio. So you can add a new source file within Visual Studios File menu but you have to add that file also to the CMake file. Every time you change a *CMakeLists.txt* and you build the project a new CMake run is automatically invoked. After that Visual Studio informs you that the project files were changed and it reloads them.

If you want to use another project configuration delete the contents of your Build-directory and run CMake again with the new configuration set to ON.
