You can find the CMake GUI tool in the Windows *Start Menu*. First you need to set the source and build directory. Then click in *Configure*. Now choose the generator to be used (e.g. *Visual Studio 8 2005 Win64*). Now choose configuration options by toggling the corresponding checkboxes. Click *Configure*  again. Click *Configure* often enough until the *Generate*-button becomes visible. Pressing *Generate* will generate the project files.
